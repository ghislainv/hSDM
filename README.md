hSDM R package
===============

`hSDM` is an R package for estimating parameters of hierarchical
Bayesian species distribution models. Such models allows interpreting
the observations (occurrence and abundance of a species) as a result
of several hierarchical processes including ecological processes
(habitat suitability, spatial dependence and anthropogenic
disturbance) and observation processes (species
detectability). Hierarchical species distribution models are essential
for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species,
predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty
in the model results.

Code and manual
---------------

The last stable version of the `hSDM` R package is officially
available for several operating systems (Unix, Windows and Mac OSX) on
the Comprehensive R Archive Network
([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hSDM/index.html)).
