Description: hSDM is an R package for estimating parameters of hierarchical Bayesian species 
  distribution models. Such models allow interpreting the observations (occurrence and abundance
  of a species) as a result of several hierarchical processes including ecological processes 
  (habitat suitability, spatial dependence and anthropogenic disturbance) and observation processes
  (species detectability). Hierarchical species distribution models are essential for accurately 
  characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and
  assessing uncertainty in the model results.
