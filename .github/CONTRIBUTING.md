# Contributing guide

The `hSDM` R package is Open Source and released under the [GNU GPL
version 3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
Anybody who is interested can contribute to the package development.
There are many ways to contribute, such as writing tutorials, examples
or tests, improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature
requests, or writing code to provide new functionalities which can be
incorporated into future versions of the package. Every contributor must
agree to follow the project's [Code Of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).

## Report an issue

If you want to report a bug, request a feature, or discuss an issue,
please open an [issue](https://github.com/ghislainv/hSDM/issues) on
the GitHub project page.

## Contribute to code

Changes to the source code and documentation should be made via GitHub
pull requests (PR).

You can learn how to do this from this *free* video series [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on
GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github),
Aaron Meurerâ€™s [tutorial on the git
workflow](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/), or the guide [How to
Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

The important steps to follow are:

1.  Start by creating a fork of the `hSDM` repository
2.  Make changes to the source code on a development branch, not the
    default *master* branch
3.  Keep your fork's master and development branches up to date with
    changes in the `hSDM` repository
4.  Commit the changes you made. Chris Beams has written a
    [guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write
    good commit messages.
5.  Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
